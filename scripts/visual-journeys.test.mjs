// The journey of the hydrated first paint (app-home-pending) flaked on a shot that was right: two things moved under it.
//  - the date in words (« Today ») is written by the SERVER's clock, which the browser's frozen clock does not reach, and the masked
//    box takes the width of its text: « vendredi 30 octobre 2026 » (24 letters) one day, « jeudi 29 octobre 2026 » (21) the next;
//  - the account mark swaps its initial for the default picture once the image is decoded: a shot taken a few frames earlier shows the initial.
// Both are settled before the shot, in `ready`, so a day or a slow runner cannot change the capture.
