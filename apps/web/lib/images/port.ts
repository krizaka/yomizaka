 * The PHOTO CLEANING port (ADR-0010). Generic on purpose — no import from this app, so another Krizaka product can lift the

 * STRIPPED (Loi 25: GPS and device data never leave the intake) and only a few facts kept — whether a camera or an editor made it.
 * Deterministic, in-process, for nothing: no model, no network.
