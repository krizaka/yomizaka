/**
 * The document PRE-FLIGHT port (ADR-0005). Generic on purpose — no import from this app, so another Krizaka product

 * real type by magic bytes, integrity, safety, cheap metadata. Deduplication (a run already exists) is the application's
 * `ReuseStore`, because it needs its data. Nothing here executes or renders a file.
