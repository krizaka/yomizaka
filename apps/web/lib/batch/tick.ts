/**
 * A batch that advances without anyone looking at it (yomizaka#240). A property manager who sends 200 leases and closes the tab
 * still gets a finished batch: every `limits.batchTickSeconds` the server takes the unfinished batches (the oldest first,
 * younger than `limits.batchTickMaxAgeHours`, at most `limits.batchTickBatches`) and advances each with its owner's settings,
 * exactly as opening the page does. One instance does it at a time (an advisory lock); one batch failing never stops the others.
