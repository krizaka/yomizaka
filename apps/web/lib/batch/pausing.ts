/**
 * Why a batch waits instead of failing its rows one by one (yomizaka#248). Two kinds, both transient:
 *  - the account cannot pay for the next row (`PAYWALL`, `DAILY_LIMIT`, `FAIR_USE`): it waits for the account;
 *  - the engine cannot take it now (`ORAZAKA_BUSY`: Orazaka allows a few concurrent runs per service account and says when to
 *    come back; `ORAZAKA_UNAVAILABLE`: it did not answer): it waits for the engine, and the batch keeps going by itself.
 * Pure: the batch's runner and its page read the same list.
