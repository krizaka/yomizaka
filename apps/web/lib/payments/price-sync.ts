 * Keeps the processor's prices equal to the catalogue the administrator edits (yomizaka#548). The catalogue (`@krizaka/settings`) is the

 * different amount creates a NEW processor price and moves the lookup key to it, so a subscription already sold keeps the price it was
 * sold at (the old price is never edited). Live mode is the owner's: this module never passes `owner`, so a live key is refused.
