 * Section G of the Québec lease (yomizaka#554, slice 1 of #104): the notice of the lowest rent paid in the twelve months before the
 * lease (art. 1896 C.c.Q., the mandatory form's section G, the same citation as QC-LEASE-008) against the new rent. Pure and
 * deterministic. It speaks only of the lease's figures — never of the landlord — and only from what the law and the TAL's table give:
 * a year the table does not hold, or a method that needs the building's own costs, gives no figure and no claim.
 * The recourse is the one of art. 1950 C.c.Q.: the tenant may ask the Tribunal administratif du logement to fix the rent.
 * Information, not legal advice (the messages say so); the rates are data (`content/tal/renewal-radar.json`), never a number here.
