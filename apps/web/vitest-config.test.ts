 * yomizaka#268: the integration files write global rows (settings, rate limits, maintenance flag) read through a cache by other
 * files; side by side on one database they flaked (api-keys rotation, global switch, api audit). The cause is fixed by running
 * the database files one at a time; this keeps it so — a file added to that project can never run in parallel with another.
