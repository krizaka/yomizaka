 * The steps of a check, one contract for every platform (the web, the Mac, iOS and Android apps): Lecture, Contrôle préalable,

 * each is DERIVED from what the product really knows (the document read, accepted, the run's status) — Orazaka's per-step live
 * events (orazaka#189) will refine the rules step through the same shape when they exist; nothing is faked until then.
